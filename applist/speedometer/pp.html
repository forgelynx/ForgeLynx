      <p>GPS Speedometer Tracker is a paid, fully offline app. It does not collect, store, sell, or share any personal data. All processing occurs locally on your device. No account creation is required.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">

      <p>We do not collect personal information, usage analytics, identifiers, or location history.</p>
